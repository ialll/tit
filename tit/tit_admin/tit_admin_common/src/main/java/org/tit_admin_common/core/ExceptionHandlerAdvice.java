 * Class to help handle the Exceptions in the application, system or any level

 * commonly handle all the thrown exceptions on the beans/classes to which it is
 * proxying. This will print the exception to console. You can extend this class
 * to have specialized Exception handler features, like sending an email to
 * developer, showing a message on frontend, attaching an error code and common
 * user understandable message.
